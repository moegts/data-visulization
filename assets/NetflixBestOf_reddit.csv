"[Discussion] Am I just late to some change, or does Netflix suddenly seem to have a lot more good non-Netflix made movies?",830,qtq00z,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/qtq00z/discussion_am_i_just_late_to_some_change_or_does/,77,"A lot of these are older, but I'm seeing more good older movies that I've actually heard of/watched: Titanic, Jumanji (original), Leon the Professional, Moneyball, A Knight's Tale, etc. I feel like for the longest time the non-Netflix made movie collection was mostly older movies that were meh or felt like the discount version of something popular - like, you wanted My Fair Lady? Well here's some other Audrey Hepburn movie you've never heard of because it didn't do well in theaters. Though now, My Fair Lady is actually in Netflix.

I'm just wondering if I'm slow to some change, maybe they saved up for the holidays, or that something is actually happening in the movie-market that's good for Netflix subscribers. Years ago, I read that Netflix's selection of shows/movies they didn't produce themselves was meh because of other companies opting to stream their own shows and Amazon using its money weight to nab up any and all unclaimed movies out there. It'd be nice if that was changing finally, and more oldie-goodies will be available on Netflix.",1636897097.0,2021-11-14 14:38:17

[DISCUSSION] (US) The Fury of a Patient Man (Tarde Para la Ira) Spain 2016: The wife of a getaway driver who is about to be released is approached by an unassuming and gentle man.,12,qu3xtc,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/qu3xtc/discussion_us_the_fury_of_a_patient_man_tarde/,2,"Reminiscent of A History of Violence, it is a dramatic examination of revenge and injustice. Winner of 4 Goya awards (Spain's Academy Award) and nominated for 7 more.

Extremely well-acted and well-paced, there is dramatic tension throughout until the last scene of the film. Any more plot summary threatens to spoil some of the many reveals the audience discovers with the characters throughout the film. Slowly the full portrait of the crime is revealed as well as the motivations of the characters. A gem.

[DISCUSSION] Arcane (2021),110,qtipzk,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/qtipzk/discussion_arcane_2021/,40,"Holy. Shit. This one came out of no where for me. Not only don't I play League of Legends but as a Dota 2 player I've grown to be a blind hater of it. But holy shit. The Netflix animated series that explores the lore behind two of the most popular characters in the game is so absolutely mind blowing it gave me a newfound love for the world of League. To put things in perspective as to how impressed I am, I would say it totally stomps Dota 2's own Netflix animated series, Dota: Dragon's Blood released earlier this year, which is by all means a great execution in its own right. For starters, the art in Arcane is so uniquely cool and animated with motion capture and stunning vfx giving fans a real treat during fight and action scenes. Next, the plot.. it is as compelling as the world-building is unreal. I really hate comparing it to Dragon's Blood--which did a great job exploring the Dota 2 lore and doing justice to the heroes--but Arcane's storyline is just in another LEAGUE as it takes on a more political-crime-drama-esque approach that only gives it more depth and more room for character development. The script and voice acting is on point. Everything about it is top notch. Dude. One of the best entertainments I have ever consumed. I just feel like I'm sucked right in in the world of League. Did I mention the character design?
  
This is Queen's Gambit caliber to me. Except it's based on a video game. On that pipeline we've had Castlevania and Dragon's Blood so far (that I know of). Neither comes close to the production level of Arcane. In fact it might be one of the few cases where the Netflix Adaptation is better than what it's adapting from. I'd be surprised if it's not received well even by non gamers. Netflix and Riot should be proud of this one.

Edit: not to mention the music. gotta love the opening credits rolling to Imagine Dragons, who made a cameo in one of the episodes.",1636866867.0,2021-11-14 06:14:27

Summary

**An uneven choral-family horror drama, which seeks the integration of the ghostly-supernatural with the psychopathological and traumatic, alternating the childhood past of its protagonists in a ""haunted house"" and their adult present. This is only partially achieved, as the development of some characters is not very convincing. Formally very accomplished, it shows undeniable and elegant moments of terror, profusion of ghosts (you have to watch it very carefully) and style marks that would reach their apogee in the later (and superior) series Midnight Mass, by Mike Flanagan himself.**

Sumario

**Desparejo drama coral-familiar de terror, que busca la integración de lo fantasmal-sobrenatural con lo psicopatológico y traumático, alternando el pasado infantil de sus protagonistas en una “casa embrujada” y su presente adulto. Lo consigue sólo en parte, dado que el desarrollo de algunos personajes no resulta muy convincente. Formalmente muy lograda, luce innegables y elegantes momentos de terror, profusión de fantasmas (hay que mirarla con mucha atención) y marcas de estilo que llegarían a su apogeo en la posterior (y superior) serie Misa de medianoche, del mismo Mike Flanagan.**

Al fin una película que no niega la pandemia de Covid. Y la aborda desde la comedia / At last a film that does not deny the Covid pandemic. And it approaches it from comedy.

Summary

Faced with a resurgent audiovisual industry that is strenuously reluctant to realize the existence of Covid-19 and worried about continuing to give a frozen image of the world in 2019, this French dramatic comedy that lifts this veil of denial is very welcome. He managed to review numerous topics of daily life during strict lockdown in the first stage of the pandemic, when not much was known about the transmission of the virus and vaccines were a very distant possibility. And it does so with remarkable rigor. Everything we see in this story will resonate and feel familiar.

Sumario

Frente a una renaciente industria audiovisual que se resiste denodadamente a dar cuenta de la existencia de la Covid-19 y preocupada por seguir dando una imagen del mundo congelada en 2019, resulta muy bienvenida esta comedia dramática francesa que levanta este velo de negación y se las ingenia para pasar revista a numerosos tópicos de la vida cotidiana durante el confinamiento estricto en la primera etapa de la pandemia, cuando aún no se sabían muchas cosas sobre la transmisión del virus y las vacunas eran una posibilidad muy lejana. Y lo hace con una notable rigurosidad. Todo lo que veamos en esta historia nos resonará y resultará familiar.

It was enjoyable. Reasonably scripted. Of course a little predictable if you saw the army of the dead. It is a significantly better movie that Zach Snyder did not get his ungifted hands on.

I recommend anyone give it a watch, I personally loathed army of the dead and I hope they scrub it from the Canon some how. Different director / writer etc. A cast of actors I don't recognize(less one) that all did a good job. And their was a couple moments where I felt my eyes water.

I did not space out 400 times like Army of the dead. Frankly I wish army of thieves was its own standalone series seperate. It is what It is

[Discussion] 3%,29,qjamv9,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/qjamv9/discussion_3/,14,"3%

A post-apocalyptic thriller set in near-future Brazil, where only a select few are allowed to join a privileged society after undergoing an intense and competitive process. You get one chance to join the 3% and be saved from poverty stricken slums.

If you’ve enjoyed the latest Korean drama “Squid Games”, then this Brazilian counterpart comes highly recommended.

The show [3%](https://www.netflix.com/title/80074220) has a total of 4 seasons available on Netflix for all the binge watchers out there.

The show has a beginning, middle and end. Fear not being left with a cliffhanger as these arcs have been completed.

There are some violent moments (shootings, murder, suicide, assaults), sexual innuendo, brief nudity, cursing (subtitled in English), and occasional smoking and drinking. 

The show is available to watch in Original Portuguese or English.

“The show’s premise is familiar, if not downright cliché: It takes place in a future São Paulo not far removed from some of the most crowded, impoverished favelas of today’s Brazil. Every year, children of the slums who have recently turned 20 can volunteer to take part in their society’s time-honored, highly anticipated tradition: an elaborate series of physical and psychological challenges known as the Process. The Process exists to separate the wheat from the chaff; only the top 3% of each class — those who possess the “merit” required to pass all the Process’s tests — can win the ultimate prize: a new life on the Offshore, a technologically and environmentally engineered island paradise where inhabitants live out the rest of their lives in total comfort, abundance, and harmony.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, such extreme economic inequality has not gone unchallenged. A rebel network calling itself the Cause (a Causa, if you’re watching in the original Portuguese) has grown in the shadows over the years, sabotaging the Offshore’s Process whenever possible. The so-called “pure meritocracy” of the Process — nevermind the extremely subjective criteria it involves — has earned the Offshore elite a lot of goodwill, and thus the Cause a lot of contempt, among mainlanders, all Process rejects who train and hype up their children so they might one day “have a better life.” It has become the basis for the dominant religion, a Puritanical faith tied to the “Founding Couple” who engineered the Offshore, that assures its followers that the most worthy chosen ones will find salvation among the Three Percent.”",1635628060.0,2021-10-30 23:07:40

Others called me nitpicky, which I disagree. I watched CW shows for fucks sake. I am absolutely capable of switching off my brain for some mindless fun. This show was just too hyped up for what I saw; I expected great writing, nuance and depth, complex characters, all of which I never got. Hell, thanks to the hype I actively tried to enjoy it, I didn't rewatch the damn thing to look for flaws, this list are just things that popped into my head while watching. As for ""it's just world building, characters"" criticism. Yes, some of it can be world building, which would only be relevant if there's a S2. There can also be checkov's gun and random details left unsaid that contribute to characterisation or storyline, but checkov's gun provides tension whereas those details flesh out characters. Many of the details in this show did neither, they were casually dropped in lines or shown for brief seconds, honestly why waste the screentime? As for the r/iamverysmart comments. You guys need better taste.](/spoilers)

There were a lot of setups for possible storylines that were plain abandoned. Various other plot holes as well. This is going to be long:

1. [Sae-byeok was showed to be a skilled pickpocket, used her skill to sneak in a knife. Never shown to pickpocket after.](/spoiler)
2. [Knife was used to unscrew an air vent. Camera specifically zooms in on the loose screw, no follow up after.](/spoiler)
3. [The knife sort of gave Sae-byeok an advantage about a game, but it is arguable. Similarly another contestant snuck in a lighter which also helped her in the game. ](/spoiler)
4. [Both items were quickly confiscated. The items were clearly contraband in the games but nothing came of it. No punishment could signify an unspoken rule that allows contestants to cheat, but nothing was elaborated further.](/spoiler)
5. [Sae-byeok and Deok-su were out for each others' lives. This was sort of abandoned mid season. ](/spoiler)
6. [Gi-hun hinted to Deok-su that he might be betrayed by his gang of thugs. There was no betrayal, the game pitted them against each other. Betrayal would be being on the same team, but intentionally sabotaged.](/spoiler)
7. [Han Mi-nyeo, the evolved korean version of a Karen. Pretends to be pregnant and cries to leave the game one moment, berates another contestant for voting to leave immediately after. Uses her own lack of shame as a weapon. Implied to be a manipulative con woman but never displayed such skills.](/spoiler)
8. [Her ""relationship"" with Deok-su was confusing. It is strongly implied that she teamed with Deok-su to use and manipulate him. Vowed vegeance for her betrayal. While she did eventually get her vengeance, she was protrayed as a spurned lover, which makes no sense. Her lack of concern for her own life contradicts her earlier character, no way she would commit a murder suicide.  ](/spoiler)
9. [Sang-woo had no reason not to tell his teammates to choose triangle in the second game. It was an individual game, all of them could've chosen triangle. At that point in the show they weren't pitted against each other, it was just a matter of surviving the game, for all they knew, everyone who survives shares the cash prize, not last one standing. Unless the writer intended for him to be so ruthless as to kill his friend for adding a billion to the total cash prize.](/spoiler)
10. [If Sang-woo was actually that ruthless, he wouldn't have teamed up with Gi-hoon, who stacked the team with a frail old guy and tiny girls. ](/spoiler)
11. [The ""betrayal"" in the sugar game didn't actually lead to anything great. Sort of grouped together into a reason to motivate Gi-hoon to kill Sang-woo, which he still didn't do.](/spoiler)
12. [Ali's 3 fingers was mentioned and shown once, there were no visible effects from the reveal. He was also said to be abnormally strong but barring one scene where he waved around a massive metal stick, nothing else was shown.](/spoiler)
13. [Ali was bound to be betrayed. However, Ali has never done anything significant for Sang-woo. Never saved his life, their relationship never went past a few conversation and some casual kindness. Sang-woo already betrayed him once in the sugar game, which could already lead to his death; what makes the second betrayal so emotional to Sang-woo? ](/spoiler)
14. [Unfeeling, unemotional, blank stare, young square who was held hostage after the sugar game. Felt like they were going for brainwashing child soldiers but nothing came from it.](/spoiler)
15. [Soldiers who get their faces seen are killed. Young square was shot in the face by Frontman. No one else gets their face seen after aside from Frontman, by the cop. No one else is killed for that reason](/spoiler)
16. [We see through Jun-ho's eyes that the soldiers are well trained and move eerily in sync. They also live in tiny prison-like rooms. Who trained them? Are they willingly participating and killing? Why? This was never expanded further.](/spoiler)
17. [Organ traficking soldiers. How the heck did they set the whole sting up? Surely they had help from even higher authorities. I was hoping for some sort of faction conflict within the game organizers, but the trafickers were killed off and that was the end of it.](/spoiler)
18. [Organizers/Soldiers who disturb the fairness of the game are killed. Organ trafickers hung from ceiling. No one else killed for that reason after that incident. No more mention of fairness either.](/spoiler)
19. [There was a throwaway conversation between the VIPs where it is hinted that they required invitation from another involved VIP to bet in the game. However, there was a slight confusion between them where no one knew who invited each other. I thought this meant they were tricked into going to the game site and was going to be thrown into the game with the peasant contestants and get killed. ](/spoiler)
20. [Bombs in the tunnel. Mentioned once in passing never used or referenced again.](/spoiler)

I'm sure there are more that I've forgotten or overlooked but I'm kinda tired already. In any case, any unsolved, unused plot points for dead characters cannot be explored anymore. Whereas it is still possible with the game organizers and soldiers. If they manage to explore them further in S2, these flaws might even become the basis of a good wordbuilding

[Request] Adult Animation that isn’t aimed at 14 year olds without parental controls,9,qi4r2r,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/qi4r2r/request_adult_animation_that_isnt_aimed_at_14/,30,"Maybe I’m just a bit salty at the moment with that title, but I’ve recently started watching Inside Job and Adventure Beast and it seems like the “adult” part of that starts and ends with swears and freely showing blood on the screen. I tried getting into F is for Family but turned it off when one character seems to exist just to drag a full diaper around them at all times. 

Meanwhile if I want an animated show that deals with complex issues like abuse and abandonment and how to be a good person in a bad world, I turn to Kipo and She Ra yet again. 

And before you suggest it, yes I’ve watched Bojack Horseman. I love it, but I’m not sure I have the emotional strength to watch it again. 

Edit: I’m in the US

I’m looking for animated shows that do more than sprinkle red pixels all over my screen or say “shit” and “fuck” with impunity. Something that has something meaningful to say or is cleverer than the average show. It doesn’t even have to be explicitly for adults. Like I said, I absolutely love She Ra and Kipo. I also like Futurama (but found Disenchantment to be disappointing) and Bob’ Burgers. And nothing that’s just goofy lolrandomness without any coherence at all. 

So what do you recommend?",1635482047.0,2021-10-29 06:34:07

[DISCUSSION] My top 10 Netflix shows this sub does NOT talk about PT 2,32,qh3ka2,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/qh3ka2/discussion_my_top_10_netflix_shows_this_sub_does/,6,"[Original top 10 shows you are not watching.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/htoqqv/discussion_my_top_10_netflix_shows_this_sub_does/)

My arbitrary methodology: I thought about shows I really enjoyed but never see mentioned around here. Then I did a search and saw if they came up with very few hits, threads or mentions.

What to expect from my list: animated shows, surreal stuff, foreign shows, shows with POC protagonists. Also minimal padding, I hate padded out shows.

Reason for posting: People complain that all we ever talk about are the same shows (Dark, Stranger Things, Black Mirror, etc).

&#x200B;

**Baki**

Similar to: Jojo's bizzare adventures. Dragon Ball. MMA.

Pitch: the son of the greatest fighter on earth tries to get strong enough to defeat his dad.

Why it is good: Bullshit and hyperbole. For real. This is an extraordinarily exaggerated show that constantly tries to explain to you why the things you are seeing make perfect sense. My typical joke is 'if an ant can lift 5000 times it's weight then Baki should be able to lift more!'. The first season is the best, with the worlds deadliest convicts dueling Japan's best martial artists in the streets with zero rules. After that it centers a bit too much on Baki himself who is just not that compelling.

**Seis Manos**

Similar to: Castlevania, Narcos, Black Dynamite.

Pitch: 3 adopted teens grow up under the tutelage of a kung fu master and use their skills to fight the Mexican mob.

Why it is good: This is the passion project by the go-to animation team that does stuff like Castlevania, Blood of Zeus and other projects for Netflix. While you can tell the budget on this is a LOT smaller than their other projects, the kung fu is gorgeously fluid and the horror and violence is wonderfully over the top.

**Live Action Kakegurui**

Similar to: Yugio, Squid Games.

Pitch: A highschool for elite kids uses gambling to prepare them for a ruthless world.

Why it is good: It is like the anime version, but a lot less horny. That said it still has the mind games, logic puzzles, tense moments and risk of real harm. It is very stagey in a great way, for example typical anime internal monologues are done by having all actors freeze while one goes off about their evil plan.

**Way of the House Husband**

Similar to: aggretsuko, Martha Stewart, Sopranos.

Pitch: a Japanese ex mobster settles down to live a happy domestic life with his working wife.

Why it is good: episodes are short, barely animated and generally silly... and it is like a soothing balm to relax and laugh. Watch a tattooed tough guy prepare beautiful meals, clean house and threaten former crime syndicate gangsters.

**Taco Chronicles**

Similar to: no reservations, gentefied, chefs table.

Pitch: Each episode learn the history, preparation and culture around a different type of taco.

Why it is so good: It is extremely well produced... each taco has a voice actor with a different personality describing itself like ""I'm not pretentious, If you show up drunk at 2 am I will make you feel better"". Photography is great, awesome interviews and beautiful locations.

**Happy**

Similar to: Max Payne, Diehard, Bad Santa.

Pitch: A washed up detective teams up with an imaginary friend to save a kidnapped girl.

Why it is so good: this show is crass, offensive, hyper violent and dark... and somehow just barely manages to stay on your good side without pushing you away. If you want some cathartic killing, drug fueled adventures and a protagonist who is distinctly unheroic you will enjoy this show.

**High Score Girl**

Similar to: Wonder Years, Boy Meets World, King of Kong.

Pitch: Boy meets girl, boy loses a match of street fighter against girl, they become rivals and friends.

Why it is so good: If you are like a late Gen X early Millenial this is a history of the video games you grew up with. Street Fighter in the arcades, Sega Genesis, sallivating over the Neo Geo... but this show will also make you cry a lot. It is funny and cute but mostly it is kids who look like kids going through drama.

**Brand New Cherry Flavor**

Similar to: Mullholand Drive, Videodrome, Lock and Key, Stranger Things.

Pitch: a talented young director moves to hollywood but has her project stolen from her. She seeks supernatural help to get it back.

Why it is so good: this is a VHS you rented by accident in the late 90's. It feels strange, silly but menacing, full of surreal horror of the body and mind. It owes a lot to Chronemberg, Lynch and Fincher (the 3 David's) but also has it's own fun voice.

**Good Girls**

Similar to: Better Call Saul, Working Moms, Money Heist, Weeds.

Pitch: 3 moms who are best friends are desperate for money so they decide to rob a supermarket.

Why it is good: Basically the sitcom version of Breaking Bad with a lot less noir and a lot more laughs. That said it can be extremely threatening, as a real sense of danger creeps in and unlike Walter White you do not expect them to outsmart everyone who crosses them.

**Hyperdrive**

Similar to: top gear, American ninja warrior

Pitch: A reality show where some of the best drift drivers in the world bring their own mismatched cars and compete against each other in stunt filled contests.

Why it is good: A huge and varied cast of drivers out to win, putting their cars on the line. And I mean cars get destroyed, you see them slowly get more and more beat up over a series of just irresponsible races and stunts. There is a lot of drama and it is one of the best reality shows in years.",1635360340.0,2021-10-27 20:45:40

Una época oscura de la historia polaca narrada con solvencia / A dark time in Polish history successfully told

Sumario

Lo que aparentaba ser en su comienzo una versión polaca de Cruising, definitivamente no los es. Se trata de un logrado neo noir, polémico por su tema para una ficción polaca, que relata una investigación policial referida a un periodo durante el que se persiguió, maltrató, fichó y en ocasiones detuvo en forma compulsiva a miles de homosexuales y heterosexuales relacionados con ellos. Esta es otra de esas películas que recrea con fuerza ese clima de época opresivo, pero también cotidiano “tras la cortina de hierro”.

Reseña: [impresionescinefilas.wordpress.com/2021/10/24/operacion-jacinto-operation-hyacinth-hiacynt/](https://impresionescinefilas.wordpress.com/2021/10/24/operacion-jacinto-operation-hyacinth-hiacynt/)

Summary

What appeared to be a Polish version of Cruising at the beginning is definitely not. It is a successful neo noir, controversial due to its subject matter for a Polish fiction, which recounts a police investigation into a period during which thousands of homosexuals and heterosexuals related to them were persecuted, mistreated, booked and sometimes compulsively detained. This is another of those films that strongly recreates that oppressive period climate, but also everyday “behind the iron curtain”.

Now you've probably heard of the underground movie Tremors. This is the story of how Perfection was created then stolen from its makers after [over 35 years of work.](https://graffitiwithpunctuation.com/opinion/fair-dinkum-terror-graboids-down-under)

Warning, [""Here be Dirt Dragons"".](https://youtu.be/YcflsJaigzk)

It all started with a man named [Steve Wilson,](https://i.imgur.com/5PQBOQQ.png) out on a rock in the middle of the desert. [Sound familiar?](https://youtu.be/PyYH2WUDx1w) 

>“One day I was sitting out there on one of those boulders and thought how interesting it would be to have something that moved through the sand like a fish, and I couldn’t get off the rock,” - [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://imgur.com/rXXVosR)

He'd go on to meet [Brent Maddock](https://youtu.be/XbmGiPuLKaw) and [Ron Underwood](https://youtu.be/ISr5dsO-jE8) at [UCLA film school](https://i.imgur.com/zwBJuhF.png) and a legendary partnership was formed. Known as special effects wizards, they made their way into the film game until writing ""Short Circuit"" and getting the help of one [Nancy Roberts](https://youtu.be/JRM7i2qQ0Mc), the [true behind the scenes figurehead of the Tremors series.](https://i.imgur.com/48hYQE1.png) With the success of ""Short Circuit"", Nancy turned to them and asked if they had anything original in their back pocket they wanted to do on their own. To which Steve pulled out.... [Land](https://i.imgur.com/IJmEinZ.jpg) [Sharks.](https://i.imgur.com/62Ywt6e.png)

And it took a lot of work to turn that into what we know. Which is why Gale Anne Hurd and Jim Jacks jumped in to help. Firstly, Universal didn't know how to [market horror-rom-coms](https://i.imgur.com/VBSsIUB.png) because Tremors was the first of its kind. Then there's Universal itself wanting to make the movie but also [thinking Tremors will fail.](https://i.imgur.com/Wg56wFf.png) Making things non-union and changing the name from ""Beneath Perfection"" to ""Dead Silence"" to hide things.

>“The studio wanted to keep the film hidden due to it being a non-union production, although they were involved at an arms-length distance with the picture being a negative pickup as opposed to a studio picture. They wanted it to be under the radar.” - [Ron Underwood](https://i.imgur.com/BbIV7OF.png)

Though the day-to-day filming was challenging due to the nature of creating a low-budget monster movie, production went surprisingly smooth thanks to the abilities of [Brent, Nancy, Ron and Steve.](https://youtu.be/hpCSCQJEmnk) Well actually, everyone involved. You already know the actors but there are some incredibly talented people involved behind the scenes. [Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis](https://youtu.be/AgZD--FSxrY) as the main creature designers of the series. Turning their [penis](https://i.imgur.com/vsItkXh.jpg) shaped designs into the [Graboids we know and love today.](https://monsterlegacy.net/2014/09/20/subterranean-terror-tremors/) That's just two of hundreds who [painstakingly created Perfection.](https://youtu.be/RwRP5mCN4iE) Steve Wilson's dad, Bob Wilson, also joined in the production of his son directing/writing/producing his first movie. He loved it so much he brought a home camera and [filmed the greatest behind the scenes series ever with it.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1EA9246EF966DDA2) The whole team did what they could with they had, trimming what they could and fighting for what they couldn't. The scene where the car is sucked under was [originally longer and about to be cut before Nancy and Jim stepped in.](http://imgur.com/a/xKeStYW) There was even two aborted openings, one with [Old Fred and Edgar,](https://youtu.be/EvwJPZa2LHU) and another with [a rabbit and coyote being eaten by Graboids after landing from space.](http://imgur.com/a/VyR1DLP) As well as a different ending.

Fun fact: [Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick's first child](https://i.imgur.com/UlrgmcJ.png) was born during the filming of the scene where Walter Chang is eaten by a Graboid. That's how committed everyone was. Also why Kevin had nightmares and [regretted Tremors until recently.](http://imgur.com/a/L8zAjwi)

But despite all that, on a budget of $11 million dollars, Tremors made $16 millon dollars in the theatre and was considered a failure at the box-office. 

Or so it would seem.... 

>""We got a backhanded compliment from them when they said, ‘We could sell an empty video box called Tremors, we have to have it.’” - [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://imgur.com/a/CllLBRC) 

With the advent of VHS and home video rentals, Tremors found its true home. And so came the call for [Tremors 2: Aftershocks.](https://monsterlegacy.net/2014/09/24/subterranean-terror-tremors-2-aftershocks/)

Originally, it was a much different movie than what we know today. Written in 1993, the first script for it had [Reba returning as Heather Gummer with Kevin Bacon as Valentine McKee.](http://imgur.com/a/jpa0TZa) There was a plethora of new characters fed to the Graboids and Shriekers, an opening with gangsters attacking a family, and ending that was so good it was re-used for the TV episode ""Shriek and Destroy"". As well as the impetus and repetition of the phrase [""Doing what you can with what you got.""](http://imgur.com/a/dtrKi0z) passed between Heather, Burt and Val. And [the best callback ever.](http://imgur.com/a/WZaw19z) But because Kevin Bacon didn't want to return since sequels were seen as faux-pas and Reba wanted to come back but couldn't due to her touring schedule, [the budget was slashed](https://i.imgur.com/Neoqdxk.png) and things were changed. Val became Grady, Heather divorced Burt and a legend was born. 

>“When my son was eight, I let him see Tremors, because at that age he could appreciate it. When I spoke to him on the phone, I asked, ‘Travis, did you see Tremors?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, I saw it. Dad, have you seen [Tremors 2?](https://youtu.be/fAlqzM0CyPI) It’s really great.’ I said, ‘Son, I’m not in Tremors 2.’ And he said, ‘No, but it’s cool.’” - [Kevin Bacon](https://i.imgur.com/VPKMTVO.png)

Fun fact: The unused designs of the Shriekers from [Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr.](https://youtu.be/KzJN3PjkiN8) were repurposed for Starship Troopers as [Arachnids instead.](http://imgur.com/a/wkvQQf2) There was even Phil Tippett joining in to help create the CGI Shriekers.

That's when things really started to change.

>“I could see where they were really excited because you’d be able to move those videos so quickly just on the word “Tremors”.” - [Cristin Carr Strubbe](https://i.imgur.com/HgJEjfD.png)

And Tremors came [Back to Perfection.](https://monsterlegacy.net/2014/09/25/subterranean-terror-tremors-3-back-to-perfection/)

A movie that gets an unfair rap because people don't like the name [AssBlasters](https://youtu.be/0ZhrvkB5nKs) (AB is what they were called behind the scenes and how Burt refers to them, I like the African word ""Impundulu""), it's the strangest of the original bunch. It has the largest set of returning cast for any Tremors entry with Burt, Nancy, Melvin, Mindy, and Miguel. It's the only film in the series that's rated PG *despite* coining and frequently using the term AssBlaster. AND it's Michael Gross' favourite Tremors movie. You're probably wondering why there's [a smaller amount of information compared to the first two movies.](https://stampede-entertainment.com/site/photos/) So did the creators.

>“We got to a point with Tremors 3 when there was no promotion at all. I remember saying to Universal, ‘There’s not even a poster to put up in a video store.’ What some stores were doing was putting up their own posters to notify customers there was a thing called Tremors 3 available. That was part of Universal’s austerity; they wanted to spend as little money as possible on these films. I’m not sure saving money on promotion is the smartest way. Rabid fans would find out about it, but as far as the general public knowing there’s another one of these movies available, that wasn’t the case.” - [Brent Maddock](https://youtu.be/urLipklOqT0)

>“Universal made a lot of money off that product, it always sold well, especially in the Asian world. I was the unit production manager on Tremors 3 and the TV series and I still get residuals off them. Ron Underwood told me a story about the premiere of his second film, City Slickers, in Japan. They sat in the theatre and nobody laughed the whole time. He was really depressed and when he came out the publicity people came up and they said, ‘There’s a lot of people that want to talk to you’. There was a line around the block and all they wanted to talk about was Tremors.” - [Tom Keniston](https://i.imgur.com/uDWeUbi.png)

>“The video department begged the studio proper to make ‘Tremors 2’ and then it was a while before we made ‘Tremors 3’. That was designed to be the last one - the thinking being that surely we couldn’t milk this for more than those two sequels. But by that time, it was rolling forward on its own momentum, and they ordered ‘Tremors 4’ almost immediately. We explained that we’d structured three to be the end of the sequels, that we’d ended the life cycle of the monster and brought it full circle. The studio wasn’t bothered and basically said, ‘Well, what can you do?’ We asked if they’d mind if we made it a Western and start over. Their response was, ‘We don’t care, as long as it’s called ‘Tremors’ - so that’s why ‘Tremors 4’ is a Western.” - [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://i.imgur.com/e1IgKrQ.png)

Which is when Tremors [landed on the small screen](https://imgur.com/gallery/6mDHTtg) in the best piece of the puzzle yet. Seriously, I'm trying my hardest not to editorialize yet [the TV show](https://monsterlegacy.net/2014/09/28/subterranean-terror-tremors-the-series/) and [4th movie](https://monsterlegacy.net/2014/09/26/subterranean-terror-tremors-4-the-legend-begin/) are my absolute favourites. That's why I've been able to track the irregularities with it. The worst is that the order of episodes is constantly distorted, leading to many viewer's confusion as characters are talked about before introduced and events referenced that haven't happened yet. It's so bad that even Google has the wrong order. [See for yourself.](http://imgur.com/a/i0yPyc5)a Not to mention how Universal has pulled it from every streaming app ever since I started this #StampedeTremors campaign so they make more more money off of [the incomplete DVD sets.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZHKZGA/ref=cm_sw_r_awdo_navT_g_KJDBS0G620W8RVYR0111)

The second is how once the TV show was greenlit, Universal immediately wanted Stampede to make Tremors 4. [To the disregard of both productions.](https://i.imgur.com/fPdB2Xp.png)

>“If Universal had been willing to delay the start of Tremors 4 by two weeks, or if Sci-Fi had been willing to wait until the end of T-4’s shoot to start the series production, Michael Gross could have been in all 13 episodes. Both sides absolutely refused to compromise, even though they’re both owned by the same parent company. After all that, Universal Home Video then delayed the release of the finished T-4 several months. Go figure.” - [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://i.imgur.com/WbfIqyp.png)

Thirdly, and what I have found as the most important, is Mixmaster. A compound created as a plot device for the TV show which allowed the DNA of any animals to be combined to create a new monster every week. 

>""But it will keep spreading, mixing willy-nilly the DNA of every plant and animal that ingests it. There'll be countless, unimaginable mutations. Grasshoppers with scorpion tails, Gila monsters with bat wings."" - Cletus Poffenberger

THIS is why [Universal stole Tremors from Stampede Entertainment.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Tremors/comments/ly4sos/universal\_hates\_tremors/) 

Do you know what the highest grossing series of all time is? 

[Poke'Mon.](https://i.imgur.com/H9Jnc0f.png) I know, right?

Because when you can crank out thousands of new monsters, you can print money from every single one of those creatures as new merchandise. So when the folks at Stampede Tremors came up with something that can do that, make those monsters both cute/scary so as to get the kids AND adults to buy the toys.... Well it's easy to see why Universal would pull some [Hollywood accounting with the series.](http://imgur.com/gallery/mFNIHV3) If Tremors can make $500 million dollars without ANY official merchandise, imagine how much it would make if you could buy Graboid plushies, AssBlaster lighters or a different Mixmaster monster whenever they rolled out? And this series has been made with lower than minimal budget. What would happen if Universal actually gave the production the money it needed? 

>""We get a lot of fans asking why they can’t buy rubber Graboids and Val and Earl action figures or video games.  Some of you have even offered to help design or even manufacture them.  Others have helpfully suggested lower-budget ways they could be produced.  Still another asked if we just had a small leftover graboid in “hardened clay” he could buy.  (Sorry, the graboids were constructed full size; the clay versions are gone, and the casting molds are huge.  Even the ¼ scale graboids are pretty big.) In answer:  we wish we could get Universal to think like our fans!  You have to believe us when we say we’re just as frustrated as you are.  We don’t control the Tremors “franchise.”  Universal Pictures has the final say over all marketing and merchandising.  I hear from sources inside Universal that the various marketing departments are expressing increased interest in our “franchise.”  In English, that means they’re recognizing that there are a lot of Tremors fans out there. Nothing is definite, but here are some of the things that are being considered at Universal: Toys, action figures, collectibles and video games.  The Tremors series is being considered for promotion in these areas, and deals may be discussed with toy companies, game designers, etc."" - [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://stampede-entertainment.com/site/fan-extras/tremors-faq/?include_category=general)

And Universal knows how to grab monsters and keep them for later. Though the classics like Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolfman, Mummy and Invisible Man are in the public domain, [you'll be sued if the image gets too close to what Universal first created.](https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2011/10/24/how-universal-re-copyrighted-frankensteins-monster/) Not just those creatures. They have Kong, Hulk, Jaws, Michael Myers, The Thing, all the Jurassic Park dinos, all the Romero zombies, Chucky, Casper, Riddick beasts, Hellboy, and Jaegers/Kaiju. Pretty much every monster you can think of that's not Godzilla. If Graboids, Shriekers, AssbBlasters and Mixmaster were added to that list, it would almost be a monopoly on monsters. In a world where the multi-verse is common, a MonsterVerse is easier to make than it seems (though they tried and fucked it up already, they WILL try again). Tremors is basically adult Poke'Mon. This is why Universal completely redesigned the Graboids, Shriekers, and Assblasters. The more they can make that associates Tremors with their version, the more they can take from Stampede before the end. 

Now the sadness comes. Time to [Bummer Down Under.](http://imgur.com/gallery/caMF83x)

With the release and cancellation of Tremors the Series, and creation and [late release of Tremors 4](https://youtu.be/bppXVxldTqU), came Universal's desire for [Tremors 5.](https://graffitiwithpunctuation.com/opinion/fair-dinkum-terror-graboids-down-under)

>""It was written while we were doing ‘Tremors 4’. Everybody was excited by the idea and, for a while there was talk of an even bigger budget and the potential for it to be a theatrical feature. So we were looking to how we could be really different."" - [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://i.imgur.com/H9Jnc0f.png)

And from 2004 to 2015, Brent and Steve would write and rewrite [Tremors 5 Thunder Down Under](https://monsterlegacy.net/2017/06/13/subterranean-terror-tremors-5-bloodlines/) 7-8 times. But it seemed that while Universal wanted it, they also didn't.

>“There was never-ending interest from the fans, I became something of a de-facto frequently asked question answerer. I lost track of the number of times I had to write ‘I’m sorry, but there’ll never be a ‘Tremors 5’.” - [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://i.imgur.com/4E1dAeB.png)

That's when Universal stole Tremors. And you should start asking yourself why a studio who thinks there is no money to be had in a series has made 7 movies and 2 TV shows from it...

>”We were on the way back from Chicago, and got a call on the road from Nancy (Roberts), who was still heading up Stampede (the production company established by Maddock, Wilson, Roberts and Underwood). She said ‘You won’t believe it! ‘Tremors 5’ is happening! They want to make it!’ We got very excited, Nancy was going to get the information so we could hit the ground running. Nancy asked whether they wanted Brent or I to direct, and they told her neither of us were going to direct or even be remotely involved in the film. We were floored - it didn’t make creative sense, and it didn’t make financial sense. The story they gave us at the time was that they needed a team that did low-budget movies. The sequels we made were all low-budget films. That clearly wasn’t the real reason, and we never were able to find out what that real reason was. We did have a ‘right of first refusal’ clause built into our contacts that had just lapsed - a clause which meant they would have had to offer the sequel to us, and, if we said no, they could then take it to someone else. But we never got any real information about what really happened that led to that.” - [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://i.imgur.com/xN7aLRE.png)

For a time, Stampede Entertainment chose to forget about Tremors since it was all they could do. Even though Universal cannibalized their script and took over half of it to make Tremors 5: Bloodlines. Nothing.

[Until Kevin Bacon came calling.](https://graffitiwithpunctuation.com/opinion/tremors-part-1)

>""Nancy called us out of the blue again and said ‘You’re not going to believe this. Kevin’s finally thinking about returning to the character of Val! They want you to come in and talk about this new series idea that he has!’ Then, when we called back to set up a time, they said ‘Oh, we’re sorry. There appears to have been some sort of mistake. No-one here wants to talk to you in any way, shape or form and never will.’ It was classic Hollywood - classic, bad Hollywood. There’s a lot of good Hollywood too, and Brent and I have experienced a lot of that. But this was not fun.” ' [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://i.imgur.com/v8NCPbl.png)

Universal/SyFy would go on to make that Tremors series anyway. Or at least a pilot of it. To the point where it had finished VFX and was able to be shown in full at festivals. But they cancelled it before it could go anywhere. Then they buried it. And no one really knows why. 

>""I looked at that character [Valentine McKee] and thought to myself, 'You know, this is probably the only character I have ever played that I want to really go back and see what’s happened to him.' He was such a fascinating character to me because he’s such an ordinary man; not that smart, not that special, and yet he had this extraordinary circumstance that he had to sort of step up to the plate for. I thought to myself, 'If you take that away, if they just went away, those worms, what does a guy like that do? The rest of his life has now really become uninteresting,' so exploring that I thought would be fun. We made an excellent pilot outside of Albuquerque, recreated the town, had a really great cast, director, and writer and to this day I still don’t understand why they didn’t want to move forward with it. It’s a real head-scratcher for me. If I honestly thought the pilot was shit then I’d say we just didn’t crack it but it was cool, and that’s a really hard balance to get, between funny and scary, as you know, that’s the sweet spot. *Tremors* was good at that."" - [Kevin Bacon](https://www.dreadcentral.com/editorials/331084/exclusive-interview-kevin-bacon-reveals-how-he-would-have-rebooted-flatliners-gushes-over-one-cut-of-the-dead/)

[Read the script for yourself.](http://imgur.com/gallery/8PxsntG) It already had Mindy and Melvin in it with the return of Burt and Earl on the horizon. And if you watch the trailer, just know that it's [completely misleading.](https://youtu.be/hWU3GpKmIvw) The redesigned Graboid lives alongside the old one and Val IS wrong when he says ""They don't plan. They don't strategize."". Him being ignorant is part of the plot. 

At this point, Universal was already in full swing creating their new Tremors movies. In the same time it took for Tremors 2 to come out after Tremors, Universal has made 3 new movies, Bloodlines, A Cold Day in Hell and Shrieker Island, and a TV show. That doesn't make much sense considering how 4 movies and a TV show were created over 25 years. For Universal to crank out 3 movies and a TV show in less than a quarter of that time is a feat in and of itself. Movies that are a shadow of what Stampede Entertainment was doing with the over-fetishisation of piss/shit humour, overt sexism/racism, and a disregard for the way the creatures behaved before. There's a part in Shrieker Island where a man is killed by a Graboid while on the toilet. And that's not the worst part. The worst is how it happens in the middle of a tropical thunderstorm while the man is making zero noise. Not even a grunt of constipation. Think on that. A monster that hunts entirely by sound, seeking out and finding someone in the middle of a rainstorm that would drown out its sound sensors. It hurts, doesn't it?

Dumb fun fact: Tremors 6 was filmed in South Africa despite taking place in Canada and is the only movie to try turning [sand into snow.](https://vimeo.com/306487819) No, there was no real reason to do it. Not to mention Kevin Bacon's daughter explaining to Burt Gummer how Graboids work. 

>“Things could get a little uncomfortable as I tried to protect the franchise. Because we had a different director who hadn’t done this before, there were certain things we would disagree with, and I’d say, ‘Burt can’t say that, because it’s not factually true.’ So there’s a real balancing act without somebody like [the original writers] Steve or Brent there to ultimately say, ‘No, that can’t be done.’... Long story short, Stampede had the will and the passion, but they did not own the property. So it was either sit out this dance and they’ll reinvent the franchise without Burt, or here’s a chance to do Burt again."" - [Michael Gross](https://i.imgur.com/MCJR8VL.png)

Bringing us to the semi-present day and the part where *#SPOILERS#* happen. 

*#SPOILERS#*

[The release of Tremors 7 Shrieker Island.](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/llwbpb/comment/gnsdx0s/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3) And >!the supposed death of Burt Gummer. But not in the good-story way.!< This was something that was merely an afterthought. 

>""They decided it just had this punch. Frankly, I thought to myself — I didn’t express it to them, but I thought to myself — ‘Maybe Universal’s getting a little tired of this franchise.’ Because this wasn’t my idea. Universal and the director came to me with this idea, and they said, >!'This could be emotionally very powerful, if we have to say goodbye to this man after 30 years. And I hemmed and hawed, and I thought about it a little bit. And I said, 'You're absolutely right about the emotional gut punch this can be.' And I said, 'You're going to hurt a lot of people's feelings.' ""What we negotiated -- well, it wasn't really a negotiation, we all agreed on this -- is that we kind of left the door open. Because although Burt is gone, we never see a corpse. We never see his remains. I said, 'I can live with this,'"" Gross said. ""Because they came to me. They said, 'Look, you've been doing this so long. What do you think?' And I said, 'Well, as long as we kind of leave the door open.' I mean, I can kind of see an eighth film where it opens with Burt in a hospital bed, in a full body cast and saying, 'I survived.' He could hardly move a muscle.!< And maybe eight is...if I had a concept for eight, it would be Burt horribly injured, but in a motorized, weaponized wheelchair that has rocket mounts on the side and can leave an oil slick behind like James Bond's car. So nobody can chase him."" - [Michael Gross](https://comicbook.com/movies/news/tremors-shrieker-island-michael-gross-on-burt-gummer-death/)

Which would be fine if that's what Universal actually did. Instead, they tacked on a cheap montage of clips at the end and make it seem like Michael Gross himself is dead. They even show clips of Hiram Gummer but nothing of Burt from the TV show despite it having more hours than the movies combined. That's how you treat the one person who has been with this franchise for the last 35 years? I smell a reboot.

And the Graboid hole deepens with the end credits. 

Ever heard of Burt Gummer Day? No, it's not something Universal made up for Tremors. It's a holiday created by [@BabyFarkMcGeeZax of Imgur.](http://imgur.com/gallery/UX0a36T) And he's been doing it for the last five years through love, effort and 4K Intergalactic Quality Gifs alone. But has Universal credited him? Nope. Michael Gross would love to know who started it but no one besides me will tell him. And here Universal is using his holiday as lines of dialogue and a marketing campaign to get people watching Tremors every April 14th.  It's pretty messed up. 

This is where people like you and I come in to play. Do you have any idea of the width and breadth of Tremors fandom? 

Remember what I said about merchandising money? Video games tie into that too. 

>""Just to be clear, a wildly successful video game (an idea we've always wanted to work on) would make Universal a fortune. Not us."" - [Steve S.S. Wilson](https://i.imgur.com/eZJ1cxy.png)

And since Universal won't make them, [Tremors fans have done what they can with what they have.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-mega-worm/id388541990)  And [there](https://www.playfg.com/dirt-dragons-game.html) are [a lot](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/531965) of [them.](https://stefanocagnani90.itch.io/tremors-thegame) All [across](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/270138/terror-below) the [spectrum.](https://www.twitch.tv/lojakk_?desktop-redirect=true)

That's not even getting into the [fan-art](https://www.deviantart.com/search?q=graboid) or [fan-fiction](https://www.fanfiction.net/movie/Tremors/) or [fan-film](https://youtu.be/yYzsJMjaH94) communities, all of which are quite wholesome even when they are being crazily sexual. [Ever seen a sexy Graboid?](https://twitter.com/ShniderMoon/status/1321000806129324034?s=20) It's.... something. And there's waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more than there should be. It's like the #1 sidekink of furries. I know, I don't understand it either, but I can sure as hell appreciate the craft. And there's hundreds of thousands of them! And millions more that are simply hiding their love of Tremors because they think it's too weird and they'll be made fun of for liking it. Someone made a not terrible remix-song of Melvin singing [""Way to go, dudes!"".](https://youtu.be/IHkPbQrEFz4) A [9 year old kid entered a mullet competition](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/2021/09/28/indianapolis-mullet-haircut-championship-hopeful-has-epic-swagger/5803110001/) because he was inspired by Kevin Bacon as Val. I haven't even mentioned the 22,000 people in the Burt Gummer Subterranean Meme Stash.

This one's weird but there's a phenomenon where whenever a earthquake or *tremors* happens, it makes half the people effected by it watch Tremors. Same with experiencing or seeing neurological body tremors. When people talk about ""tremors"" in any aspect, it gets people watching the movies. I see it because I look up the word ""Tremors"" everyday on Twitter and that's the big three I see. And the first two cause and effect the later. It's strange. But free advertising!

There's a freaking subreddit for it! r/Tremors

Then the podcasts!! Practically everyone and their mother has done a 2 hour podcast on why Tremors is the greatest horror-rom-com movie series ever. SO many that I won't even attempt to list them. Just search Tremors and podcasts. [There's thousands.](https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&search_query=tremors+podcasts) The same goes for video [reviews](https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&search_query=tremors+review), [reaction watches](https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&search_query=tremors+reaction) and [reconstructions](https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&search_query=tremors+explain) on Youtube. Too many to list. It's the go-to movie when people want to point out underrated horror, a feel-good time, or tight screenplays. So much so that they use Tremors as study material in film schools across the world. 

James Gunn loves the movie so much he made sure to reference it in Slither by naming [the school after THE Earl Bassett.](https://np.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/pkakwa/the\_high\_school\_in\_slither\_2006\_a\_movie\_about/) Jon LaJoie loves it so much he wrote an album and song around it called [""Wolfie's Just Fine"".](https://youtu.be/yYHFAHldg\_8) And [Rick and Morty referenced it twice last season.](https://youtu.be/UHbQMeT45BY)

Half of the quotes you read are because the folks at [Hollywood Unseen saw what I was doing,](https://graffitiwithpunctuation.com/opinion/tremors-part-3) asked Steve a bunch of questions and wrote the answers down.

Hell, most of this information comes from [""Seeking Perfection"",](https://twitter.com/TremorsGuide?s=20) the [Tremors biography by Jonathan Melville.](http://jonathanmelville.co.uk/projects/tremorsguide/) He literally wrote a 300 page book because there wan't one and he thought there should be. Because when you need it, and don't have it, ya sing a different tune. 

Steve S.S. Wilson is such a fan of the series that even after he and Stampede were kicked out, he has spent the last 6 years answering questions on the [Tremors FAQ page section of the Stampede Entertainment website.](https://stampede-entertainment.com/site/fan-extras/tremors-faq-ask-a-question/) Ask yourself or send some love, they can sure use it. The only reason I was able to get the famous copyright lawyer, [Marc Toberoff,](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/friday-the-13th-copyright-termination-appeal-1235023236/) to take the Stampede Tremors case was because I sent so many people there that someone [happened to ask](https://i.imgur.com/ldMfTiY.png) about the [copyright expiration clause.](https://i.imgur.com/9VBCgLj.png) Because after [35 years,](https://i.imgur.com/AzzfOx3.png) the [original creators can take their creation back.](https://i.imgur.com/MyAjHxe.png)

The time is running out though cause I can tell Universal plans a remake/reboot so they can run the clock til the Stampede Tremors team dies of old age. It's another one of those things I would [looooooove to be wrong about.](https://np.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/ex5szm/fast\_furious\_two\_years\_ago\_i\_called\_hans/) But if people can get mad enough to #RestoretheSnyderVerse when Zac Snyder didn't even create the characters of DC then we can #StampedeTremors until the series goes back to Perfection. These people spent over 35 years of their lives making monster movies for our entertainment. The least we can do is let them finish what they started. They're owed that. We all are. 

Because when someone's creation can be taken away that easily after so much time, love, and effort than how could any of us feel safe creating anything ever again?

I enjoy community watch parties where I can read fan comments in the chat room during a show or movie and was wondering if others feel the same. I'm willing to help setup a watch party or, as a last resort, host myself. I figure Twitch is the easiest combined with Chrome and an extension.

Let me know if there's a group of interested people and enjoy your shows!

Edit:

Looks like I'll host. I'll start with a marathon of Umbrella Academy, people can join whenever as I'll keep it going. (Can always skip or backtrack to an episode based on the people in the chat room.

Instructions:

Everyone will have to download the Chrome Ext : ""ViewingParty""

Once downloaded, click on ""Join a Party""

Then enter the Twitch Channel ""ViewingPartyNet""

We can vote on what to watch next, or I can give instructions on how to host a watch party yourself.",1634455962.0,2021-10-17 09:32:42

Summary

**Squid Game is a series with a wonderful production design, a staging that displays a powerful iconography and that admits several readings and records various influences and cinematographic antecedents. Anyway, it is mostly a thriller and a melodrama. Erecting it as a sociopolitical essay is perhaps an excess, although the crude allegory of neoliberal capitalism is clear and its anti-meritocratic message is accurate.**

**El juego del calamar es una serie con un maravilloso diseño de producción, una puesta en escena que despliega una poderosa iconografía y que admite varias lecturas y registra varias influencias y antecedentes cinematográficos. De todos modos, es sobre todo un thriller y un melodrama. Erigirla como un ensayo sociopolítico acaso sea un exceso, aunque es clara la cruda alegoría del capitalismo neoliberal y certero su mensaje antimeritocrático.**

Summary

**Nothing new in this new nordic noir, which contains ingredients to which the subgenre has us accustomed: overload bordering on the implausible of dark family plots crossed by abuse, abandoned women detectives, addicted to their work and who postpone their family life, couples of detectives who at first detest each other and then hit it off, apparently poorly solved cases that could be reopened and the already plentiful use of clues with symbolic charge left by serial killers at the scene of the crime.**

Sumario

**Nada novedoso en este nuevo nordic noir, que contiene ingredientes a los que nos tiene acostumbrados el subgénero: sobrecarga rayana en lo inverosímil de oscuras tramas familiares atravesadas por el abuso, detectives mujeres abandónicas, adictas a su trabajo y que postergan su vida familiar, parejas de detectives que al principio se detestan y luego congenian, casos aparentemente mal resueltos que podrían reabrirse y el ya hartante recurso de las pistas con carga simbólica que dejan los asesinos seriales en el lugar del crimen.**

[Discussion] Squid game was a fucking mess of a series and it's a shame,0,q988hf,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/q988hf/discussion_squid_game_was_a_fucking_mess_of_a/,8,"I finally watched and I wanna rant a bit. A lot of people say it was godsent, a lot of people say it's hot garbage. I am more of a central-good. It has really interesting concepts but the execution is a trainwreck. I will try to present actual valid points instead of nitpicking show logic.


1. I have no fucking clue what narrative they were trying to push. 

Two narratives seem to struggle to get the spotlight ""Average Joe being down on his luck"", which would focus more on commentary and themes Vs ""Brotherly betrayal"" which would focus more on characters and relationships. Neither work. Why? Because there's not enough development for either. 


For average Joe narrative there's not really anyone to root for. Player 456 is a cunt and remains a cunt by the end(I will go in depth later.) and the actual relatable, root-for-worthy characters are pushed aside.



For brotherly betrayal there's not enough development of the two main relationships to actually care. The cop and the front man relationship could have been cool, but it wasn't developed enough. They acted like the cliff scene is supposed to be this big ass OMG reveal but I didn't feel anything because I didn't spend enough time with those two to actually care. Same with 456 and Sang-woo! I honestly didn't know if they were friends or brothers until the last episode. But it wouldn't have mattered. Why? Because there was no development! They felt like two dudes who used to hang out occasionally in school and that's it, yet they act like it's this really brotherly relationship when Sang-woo bites the dust. Fuck off, would you? The whole show feels like big ass chunks were cut.... important chunks.



2. Wow, that was one shitty main character.


The actors did a great job, this is about the characters themselves, not the actors, I think they were great. 


I don't have a problem with shitty people being main characters, as long as that's acknowledged by the narrative. If the narrative acts like the character develops and grows (like in 456's case), then I expect the character to grow. So 456 started a cunt and....remained one? Let me ask you, what changed about him? He's now rich! But still a bad father, a shitty son and now...a vigilante? Or something... whatever that ending was... Not really a root for guy. They try to sell him as a down on his luck guy so you can relate (we all had a bad dice roll at some point). But besides getting fired and that protest, most of his problems are his fault. What's worse, it can be easily fixed! Play with his (pretty obvious) PTSD. There was only one scene showing how the trauma affected him. Have more scenes, show us how he tries to get his shit together but the trauma stops him and he slides back into gambling to cope with it. Instead, all I see is a manchild refusing to grow up... at least if he'd be likeable or more D E V E L O P E D, so I can root for him. Or better yet...

2.1 Focus on Ali or the cop and the front man or the North Korea plot. 


All these characters fit the themes better with the added bonus of being likeable. Ali for the Average Joe and The cop for brotherly betrayal. 

Idk, man... there's better options for the main character.

3. What messages and commentaries there were, they were pretty half assed.


Something something... society ignoring the poor. It's not a bad commentary per say... it's just not enough. In Korea, the problem is way more nuanced. The poor are ignored as they are seen as a failure due to how Korean society pushes the youth to be successful and some succumb under the pressure. They dabled with the idea through Sang-woo, but they didn't explore it enough to do it justice. Speaking of social stratification...

4. How the hell is this show seen as ""anti-rich"" or ""us the many Vs them the few"" or ""rich people bad"" or whatever?

I've seen many posts with titles like ""Squid game makes a statement about rich people"" bla bla Like...how? Only one time did I see the R I C H portrayed as evil, during the first day when they didn't mention that you'll get killed when eliminated...that could be seen as a bit manipulative...Or when they manipulated Ali and the NK girl into it. Otherwise, I'd say they are just cunts with some required behaviour to make them the antagonists. In a show full of assholes and cunts, they are just a different nuance.

[ARG] Fever Dream (2021): La amenaza está en los detalles / The threat is in the details,4,q851x9,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/q851x9/arg_fever_dream_2021_la_amenaza_está_en_los/,0,"

La amenaza está en los detalles / The threat is in the details

Sumario:

La directora Claudia Llosa lleva adelante un relato complejo e inquietante, bastante fiel a la novela de Samanta Schweblin (ambas son coguionistas del film), un thriller psicológico con aristas de terror donde las amenazas y el peligro que tensan la cuerda de la “distancia de rescate” entre una madre y su pequeña hija podrían ubicarse en el plano de lo fantástico, en el más real de los mundos o en ambos.

El concepto de distancia como límite que opera en un vínculo (y que es factor de angustia en la película), cobra una inquietante cualidad premonitoria (la novela es anterior a la pandemia de covid) ya que hoy resulta inevitable relacionarlo con el de distancia social y con otras realidades de un entorno amenazante.

Reseña: [impresionescinefilas.wordpress.com/2021/10/14/distancia-de-rescate-fever-dream/](https://impresionescinefilas.wordpress.com/2021/10/14/distancia-de-rescate-fever-dream/)

Summary:

The director Claudia Llosa carries out a complex and disturbing story, quite faithful to the novel by Samanta Schweblin (both are co-writers of the film), a psychological thriller with edges of terror where the threats and the danger that tighten the rope of the “distance of rescue ” between a mother and her little daughter could be located in fantastic elements, in the most real of worlds, or in both.

The concept of distance as a limit that operates in a bond (and that is a factor of anguish in the film), takes on a disturbing premonitory quality (the novel predates the covid pandemic) since today it is inevitable to relate it to that of social distance and with other realities of a threatening environment.

I just finished watching Squid Game, like everyone else and I’d love to watch something similar (I have seen Alice in Borderland).

Korean movies have always been my favorite. I’ve seen all the films of Bong Joon-Ho (my favorite director), Park Chan-Wook, I’ve seen The Good, the Bad, The Weird, Chaser, A Bittersweet Life, I Saw The Devil, The Wailing, Train To Busan, Joint Security Area, Man From Nowhere, Burning and probably a bunch more I can’t recall.

Typically I wouldn’t be into the latter types of films but they’re so well-made. Koreans just know how to make really great violent revenge movies. What I’m usually more interested in are movies like Spring, Summer, Winter, Fall, and the work of Chang-dong Lee (even though I’ve only seen Burning).

I’m interested in seeing that show about the kid who cleans up deceased peoples homes (not sure what it’s called) and I’m starting kingdom right now.

Other than that i don’t have any idea whats out there.

Summary

This Russian series is a family drama and police thriller with elements of science fiction. What happens when a family in crisis incorporates a robot whose mandate is to consolidate families and who suggestively also has the ability to attack and even kill human beings? What will be the impact of this new type of robots in the world of work? What resistance do robots generate in that society?

Better Than Us features several achievements (including some very Russian humor and very elegant production design); it is not a series that goes to the side that one hopes, but at various times it loses strength due to an excessive extension as a result of the regrouping of the conflicting sides and the dynamics of the protagonist family.

Sumario

Esta serie rusa es un drama familiar y un thriller policial con elementos de ciencia ficción. ¿Qué pasa cuando una familia en crisis incorpora a una robot cuyo mandato es consolidar familias y que sugestivamente tiene también la capacidad atacar e incluso matar seres humanos? ¿Cuál será el impacto de este nuevo tipo de robots en el mundo laboral? ¿Qué resistencias generan los robots en esa sociedad?

Mejores que nosotros presenta varios logros (entre ellos cierto humor muy ruso y un muy elegante diseño de producción); no es una serie que va para el lado que uno espera, pero en varios momentos pierde fuerza debido a una excesiva extensión fruto de los reagrupamientos de los bandos en pugna y de la propia dinámica de la familia protagonista.

[DISCUSSION] Midnight Mass - the strength of NOT being what one expects it to be,449,q5a0lf,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/q5a0lf/discussion_midnight_mass_the_strength_of_not/,83,"Many very good posts here about the miniseries, and having seen some ""erudite"" critics in the press utterly miss the point, maybe below is not repeating too many things...

IMHO, where Midnight Mass absolutely excels is how it merely frames via the horror genre, and a classic theme in that, meditations on the human condition, our purpose (if any) and position in the physical and spiritual Universe. If you think of how Ray Bradbury framed his stories in his volume October Country, and then packed them full of poetry, humanism, and philosophical references, well, that is where Midnight Mass positions itself in the horror genre.

It is *not* a a vampire horror series - it merely uses vampire horror to introduce a trigger and a catalyser into the story. It is like the shop opening in Stephen King's *Needful Things*... it merely triggers and brings to surface old, even ancient, issues, conflicts, thoughts and antagonisms.

It is *not* an action horror - it has elements of it, but uses that sparingly, with long meditations, characterisations and character developments in-between. Some may hate it exactly because of this, as it departs from ""OK tell me what happens next, quickly, with x & y horror element"".

It does *not* regurgitate old vampire cliches as its *main* vehicle. Some elements exist, but they are used to build up vast questions about what is holy, sacred, or the opposite of those things.

Flanagan dares to drop theological and philosophical *nukes*, and some were not even noticed by erudite critics in some major papers.

Some of his monologues, that some are absolutely entitled to hate if they want to crack on with the horror plot, are simply *astonishing.* On the surface, the monologues are brilliant characterisations, but, gosh, the amount, the depth, and quality of stuff he packes into them.

A few minutes from the sheriff build up into an X-ray image of post-9/11 society, with its prejudices, paranoia, racism.

A few minutes from a main protagonist build up in such a poetic and point by point perfect depiction of physiological death that it is as if Stephen King and Ray Bradbury together coined it.

A few minutes of musing from the priest build up into shockingly daring iconoclastic demolitions of what we take for granted as sacred, it shifts references points, it turns upside down almost everything taken as an untouchable 'given' for millennia.

The writing is exquisite, many passages combine Carl Sagan's very special kind of spirituality rooted in vast knowledge of the vast Cosmos, the best of humanist meditations from Ray Bradbury, and the musings about our puny human condition by Stephen King and, dare I say, Edgar Allan Poe.

The acting is stellar, and casting played a huge role. Whilst we have long monologues about millenia of preconceptions, philosophy, and theology, we do have remarkably economic solutions, too... Think of the resigned, almost tired, monosyllabic reaction of the priest when someone walks in at the worst possible moment.

Frankly, and I shut up here: I simply cannot believe such a series could have been made, with such courage in 2021 as a ""mainstream"" television mini-series. Some of the philosophical and theological nukes, paired with the poetic writing, are a revelation in a landscape of more and more endlessly cliche-regurgitating script writing.",1633879136.0,2021-10-10 17:18:56

I'm a bit out of practice with all the random 'not particularly legal' streaming sites, but searched a bunch of those and couldn't find it. Even the original broadcaster, Seven Network in Australia, doesn't seem to have any mention of it on the website. Did this show just disappear off the face of the earth?

[DISCUSSION] Luna Park.,145,q4zq5i,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/q4zq5i/discussion_luna_park/,15,"This one just got released a week ago. It's a Italian period drama set in the 1960's. This one really surprised me. It's set in a carnival called (you guessed it) Luna Park, and two young women who's lives are intertwined. You have Nora who lives with her family at the carnival and Rosa who has a rich family. Rosa is looking for her lost sister.

This show is a really nice surprise. It's a easy binge, only six episodes. But I was surprised at how much I just became engrossed with all the characters!.  If I were to describe the show...it's almost like a 1960's Italian version of ""The O.C"" (with a bit of ""GATSBY"" thrown in there). It has the whole class divide between the rich and poor.   and it also has some crazy plot twists and cliffhangers!. It has a great soundtrack too. It starts a little slow but stick with it, by episode 2 the pace starts to pick up. By around episode 4 (which is a banger of a episode). I was amazed that a couple scenes made me teary eyed.",1633834464.0,2021-10-10 04:54:24
[Discussion] Diana a musical - proshot on Netflix,1,q5lhtp,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/q5lhtp/discussion_diana_a_musical_proshot_on_netflix/,0," Diana a musical, a protshot, has been released on Netflix and I need emotional support. I've watched it twice this weekend and I'm devastated.

The casting was gorgeous. Everyone was perfect for their part, and the double casting was clever and pointed. Jeanna de Waal was on-point, powerful, and could do that polite by sly smile that Diana sometimes put on to show she wasn't just an obedient princess of the crown. The Queen? A bit of a mawkish representation, imo, but I thought her 11 o'clock number was a well-balanced statement of softness and duty. When the same actress played the gossipy romance novelist, I adored her.

The play moves \*fast\*. I was young when all this went down so there were some details I had to pause and google. However, I remember being in high school and up late watching television, and seeing the news brief with footage of the car wreck. I cried that night and cried again on both viewings of her swan song. I think it was the lost future, the good she did and could have done, and seeing her journey that got to me.

And I just want to say that her magic wedding dress was a delightful gag.",1633916498.0,2021-10-11 03:41:38

Summary

Another series that goes from more to less, which promises to be a police thriller with mystery and class and is mutating into a dirty police thrilelr of revenge and action with elements of espionage, while it is convoluted and accumulating unlikely and even confusing situations. The monotonous performance of its protagonist, who turns non-stop from a loving husband in love and father to an impulsive, violent and irascible (and unbearable) type of arms to take, does not help either.

Sumario

Otra serie que va de más a menos, que promete ser un thriller policial con misterio y clase y va mutando a un policial sucio de venganza y acción con elementos de espionaje, mientras se va enrevesando y acumulando situaciones inverosímiles e incluso confusas. La actuación monocorde de su protagonista, que vira sin escalas de amante esposo enamorado y padre a un tipo impulsivo, violento e irascible (e insoportable) de armas tomar, tampoco ayuda a transitarla.

La trama va más allá de la contienda entre el bien y el mal, ubicando la fe, la razón, el fanatismo, las adicciones, las frustraciones, la compulsión, la culpa, el terror y también la generosidad en un territorio de disputa por la interpretación de una realidad que comienza a mostrar sucesos sorprendentes, en un relato que jamás incurre en el miserabilismo, dadas las múltiples dimensiones de sus criaturas.

Gran puesta en escena y actuaciones notables en la que sin dudas es una de las series del año.

Summary

A drama with solidly constructed characters that admirably and with great originality combines religious elements with certain topics of fantastic horror, in such a way that they re-signify each other.

  
The plot goes beyond the contest between good and evil, placing faith, reason, fanaticism, addictions, frustrations, compulsion, guilt, terror and also generosity in a territory of dispute for the interpretation of a reality that begins to show surprising events, in a story that never incurs miserabilism, given the multiple dimensions of its creatures.

  
Great staging and remarkable performances in what is undoubtedly one of the series of the year.

"[Discussion] ""Squid Game"" is laughably bad and extremely overrated",15,q3gt6d,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/q3gt6d/discussion_squid_game_is_laughably_bad_and/,53,"*NOTE 1*: I know there already was a [post like that](https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/pvnkqx/discussion_squid_game_is_a_bad_overhyped_show/), but I want to present my own arguments, which also touch on the overall structure of the show.

*NOTE 2*: English is not my native language and it's late where I live, so I apologize for any mistakes or bad wording.

My opinion of the show is pretty extreme because I don't get how so many people love it so much that even I regularly see memes about it. If it was just a bad show, I would forget about it the moment I finished the last episode, but I am extremely curious how people do not see that...

# Squid Game is a dumb, poorly written show reliant on cheap drama

I'll start with the low-hanging fruit - the dumb stuff. It can be considered nitpicking, so you can skip it if you are interested in reading more constructive criticism. But I think listing just how much shit the writers missed or did not care about sets the stage for taking the show apart further.

## Dumb stuff

* Does the ""recruiter"" guy at the metro station has some sort of superpower? How does he always win a hundred times in a row against everyone (as it is shown later)? My first thought was that it is sort of a metaphor for capitalism, but as the show went on I realized that I was giving the writers too much credit and he is just that good at the game, I guess.
* It is pretty clear that the game will have only one winner, but the protagonist constantly tells everyone how they'll win together and live happily ever after, and I don't think anyone says a word about it. I think even ""Hunger games"" addressed that part about the alliances in their movie.
* How big is this fucking place? They have *gigantic* rooms for some games, the first one even had a huge automatic hatch. In ""Saw"" movies (at least first ones), for instance, they at least try to keep it grounded in terms of size. I get that in squid game it's implied that there is just a couple of rooms where they change the decorations but come on.
* They have a billion cameras everywhere and people constantly monitoring each one of them, but they don't have cameras in the toilet? Surprising decency. Also, with all these cameras they can't find the policeman, they do not notice people melting sugar with a lighter, etc.
* In the last game, players could have pretty easily get across on the ""rails"" that glass lays on. And do not tell me about the ""rules"", the shit that they accepted as completely within the rules during the ""marbles"" game is ridiculous - for example, one of the minor bad guys was winning, and then they decided it's ""fair"" to switch the game? WTF was that - if I am beating you at chess, it is not ""fair"" to suddenly switch to checkers rules in the middle of the game.
* Also, not a criticism but a funny observation - one of the notes guards gave to the doctor was *inside a boiled egg with an intact shell* \- how did they put it there?

## Poorly written

It has an **incredibly inconsistent internal logic:**

* In one of the episodes, the frontman kills the red suit guy because ""he violated the first principle"", which is that competition has to be fair, by giving hints to the doctor. In the previous episode, the same frontman *purposefully* did not give food to some people to incite a fight. Even if that was part of the games, not feeding some people is obviously not fair. You also can not say that they brought food for everyone and some players just took food from the others, because one of the red suit guys straight-up said that they did not give players enough food intentionally. Also, the different shapes for the sugar game were definitely not fair. As well as the last game, obviously. You can't set up a menacing villain with a strict code if he constantly contradicts himself.
* The protagonist signed a ""disclaimer of physical rights"", which I think the game organizers use to legitimize their actions, along with additional contracts to participate in a game? If so, and they set everything up to be perfectly legal, then why are they scared of the police finding out? If they don't care if the police finds out, why do they kill the policeman?  If they do care and they know that what they do is illegal anyway, then *why bother* with contracts and rules, and even try to follow them when players first vote to stop the game? The fact that the organizers have to obey the rules too is pretty important in the story but does not really make sense. If they were afraid that police finds out about the definitely illegal stuff, such as the organ trade - then why did the frontman explicitly state that he does not care about that? It is possible that everything they did was illegal and they knew it, and rules were all internal to the games, but the show is constantly trying to make it look like it is not the case.

So, the game is neither fair nor has a strict rule set, agreed upon by both players and organizers, and both of these facts are pretty important to the drive of the story. Now about simply bad craftsmanship:

* **Why the fuck** would the old guy want to stop the game during the first vote, considering the reveal in the end?
* The quiet and supposedly somber scenes in this show are the most boring shit ever. I almost fell asleep during the final dialog between the protagonist and the old guy, and when the girl was sharing her life story. The dialog is super stiff - actors overdo it with pauses and grunts, writers overdo it with rhetorical questions, ""simple banter"" and stuff like that. Sometimes it **really is** like listening, for example, to two of your coworkers in real life, except you can't say ""welp, gotta get back to it"" and leave when they pause for a second.
* The ""believer"" guy is a parody of the ""devoted christian in a life-or-death situation"" trope rather than an actual character. His dialog is so bad it's good sometimes. Shit he says about God creating man on the 6th day when choosing a number in the glass game is so out of the left field and doesn't have nothing to do with anything it cemented him as a complete joke.
* Speaking of jokes - **EVERYTHING about VIPs is turbo cringe**. At that point, the show became a complete farce but kept demanding to be treated seriously. It is unforgivably stupid, it is a caricature of the leftist caricature of the rich people. And even worse, I think it was supposed to be a sort of statement about exploitation and how the rich are so detached from reality? But how do I not laugh when the set design is straight out of the 80s direct-to-video shlock, one rich fat guy sits on the sofa with his legs on a woman's back, head rested on the other woman's boobs, both women are painted like leopards and they make a joke about 69 *THREE TIMES*?
* About cheap drama - everyone has some sort of crybaby back story, delivered in the most boring way the writers could have come up with (except for the protagonist, his story about the factory strike was fairly interesting and the presentation was fine). I get that that is sort of the point, but sometimes less is more. Also, around the middle of the marbles game, the protagonist and his brother are slowly losing simultaneously, I think they even cue the dramatic music at some point. I mean, obviously, they could not simply win, but having them lose at the same time, in the same way, is pretty cheap.

Overacting does not help either, as well as attempts to create artifical deep meaning, which is a whole another topic in itself (note that I am a very leftist person myself, I just also prefer the shows I watch to be good).

&#x200B;

Overall, I think the show is average for the majority of the episodes with a sharp drop in quality closer to the end, where it becomes below average or simply bad for the most part, and so-bad-its-good at its best.",1633635430.0,2021-10-07 21:37:10

"[DISCUSSION] Squid Game is full of plotholes, lazy & inconsistent writing. Please explain the hype to me",14,q1h1wf,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/q1h1wf/discussion_squid_game_is_full_of_plotholes_lazy/,59,"The first episode got me absolutely hooked! Finally, I thought. An original, smart, well made story by competent writers. I was so interested to find out more about the depth of the game.. so many questions. 

However, this turned into major disappointment which later developed into a strong curiousity. I'm genuinely curious about all the people who hype this show up and call it a masterpiece. I mean, please enlighten me! Do you just not care about plot holes and realisticness at all? Or did you not notice these things? In either case, please help me out by telling me how you react to these things and still can enjoy the show.

<All through inconstistency in story>
1. After the second game, a pink suit guy is shot in the face and told by the boss that ""these people have spent their entire lives in injustice and we are finally giving them a fair chance to win in life"" - this sparked my curiousity about the masterminds of the game... until I realized this didn't matter the slightest. The games are luck oriented with no respects to fairness for the competitors. The glass bridge was literally 100% luck based, there was no skill or any justice involved whatsoever, whoever was first would lose automatically. THEY SHUT DOWN THE LIGHTS when a man had a fair skill that he could use to win...  

2. ""I never forced anyone to play the game"" says the old man in the end. MAN, Half the competitors were shot in the first game when they had not accepted to anything and had no idea that elimination ment being shot.

3. How is it not major worldwide news that every year 455 South Korean people of which many have families disappear and die?? I guess if they never lift this up in the series it's not a problem..

4. The organizers talk of the game rules as something HOLY and they have to be fair and transparent but they throw their own rules and logic out of the windows when it's convenient. For example they say that the players only had to complete the games to win, well... they mentioned nothing of the fact that they had to fight and kill eachother inbetween the games to succeed...
5. I could find a dussin more examples but I'll spare you.

<COMPLETE UPSIDE DOWN HUMAN BEHAVIOUR>
This show is supposed to take place in South Korea right? With human beings? On Earth? Because they sure as hell aren't behaving anything like human beings.
1. YES, even society's most vulnurable people are logical thinkers. No human, regardless of economical situation would ever even consider joining this game. Do people not realize there will be only 1 winner? Or.. no? Although the games are cruel, unfair and imoossible to prepare for, they all think they can win..? 

2. Human beings are a lot more critical than this. The players trust these cruel people blindly with no evidence that they will pay them. They don't even know who these games are run by OR WHY,  so why the hell would they trust them? 

3. ANY RATIONAL OR IRRATIONAL HUMAN BEING would vote to end the game after the glass bridge, as they would realize they have 0 gurantees of winning as it's 100% luck. 

4. THE VIPS.... If there's one thing George RR Martin's writing has showed me, it is that a bad guy should never be bad for the sake of being bad. WHO THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE?! A person with 0 empathy in their body cannot possibly function in society. It's so ridiculous. Imagine these VIPs' day to day life. ""Honey I'm bored, throw me some blind folded dudes in the room I wanna shoot!""- also can we get a cute puppy for me to tear up open with a knife later? - I feel kinda bored today...""  

The old man says that he was bored with being a billionare so he and his friends decided to relive their childhood joys and play these games again... but they have to murder a lot of people if they lose the games because... otherwise it wont be fun.. right? I mean, just TRY to write a reasonably good character next time. The VIPs dont even seem to care much about the games as they are explained what the squid game is while they are midthrougj watching the end..

5. The competitors are disturbingly untraumatized by these events. Yes, even the toughest gang members in the world develop PTSD.

6. Before the games, people are disturbingly calm, delivering COOL one-liners although they are aware that they will certainly meet their deaths in an unfair game which is impossible to prepare for.. I just dont buy it, the ""cool"" ice cold girl becomes lame as fuck. Real human beings would stress the fuck out and have panic in these situations.

7. The main character who has seen 454 people die in front of his eyes act in the last scene as if he had never seen murder in his life.

8. The ending explaination was so, so, disappointing. All the talks about giving the players justice once and for all meant absolutely nothing. The only reason for these games was some bored rich dude.

9. Don't even get me started on the police's story that went absolutely nowhere with so much build up and 0 payoff for the sake of a plot twist. 

Now please tell me. Are you either completely immune and not bothered by these things, or do you see them but choose to ignore? Which one is it? Thank you for answering.",1633386634.0,2021-10-05 00:30:34

The show had an awesome start and was one of the best survival shows ever, heck one of the best series that came out lately. However, the reason behind organising the games and those anti-climatic VIP characters left me a bit disappointed.

Throughout the show (pre VIP appearance) I prayed for squid games to be some sort of government-led spy training or a private military contractor job interview. Now hear me out, seemingly unsuspicious-looking people from a diverse background, with enough motive to gain money through questionable means, as well as a questionable moral compass, willing to do anything and everything based on given instructions sounds like the perfect people to hire as spies or undercover hitmen.

I feel like having the games being run by some sort of organisation and giving them a meaning that's more than just ""rich people get the fuzzies by watching people kill each other"" could have given the show more potential for more seasons or maybe spin-offs. Also it would have spared us from seeing that white guy's bare bottom and the horrible acting that came with it.

[DISCUSSION] I will never forget the day I looked up who played the title character after watching the movie Kate (2021) and found out it was Mary Elizabeth Winstead.,0,pzwd8y,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/pzwd8y/discussion_i_will_never_forget_the_day_i_looked/,11,"Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance in the Netflix original action movie Kate was an ethereal and dimension-transcending experience for me to witness. I hope the memory of it never fades too much and can always be made freshly vivid by re-watching, like the best moments of my first time watching The Princess Bride or Fight Club. 

Like Fight Club, this movie was a mindfuck for me, but unlike Fight Club, it was more thanks to the star's performance than the also-impressive work of the writer or director. You see, Mary Elizabeth Winstead **fucking shapeshifted**, and **I mean that so literally** that in my view *it is no longer allowed to be used as a figurative description* of other impressively character-embodying performances. 

Yet, despite how much I can't understate how surprisingly my statement is literally true, I don't mean it completely literally. The literal truth of it is only scratching the surface of it. You see, Mary Elizabeth Winstead's change in appearance with this transformation left her unrecognizable to me, but it wasn't the new appearance that stopped me from recognizing her - I can recognize what any version of her *looks* like just fine: *that face*. What didn't ring a bell is *who* that transformed face belonged to, and I couldn't figure out the answer to that for the same reason that transformation happened in the first place: the sheer professional discipline and talent of Mary Elizabeth Winstead as an actress. 

Ever since I saw her portrayal of the live-action version of the captivating Ramona Flowers, from the Scott Pilgrim comic series even more mindfucky than Fight Club and even more flawless in its portrayal of romance than The Princess Bride, I've been in love with her face. Not the actress herself, who wouldn't reveal her true self for me to love until years later, but the face she presented as Ramona Flowers.

My obsession with the comics and her character in them surely transferred over to her appearance with a great deal of weight to cement a sense of attachment. For a while there I probably would have said Mary Elizabeth Winstead was my natural idea of the most perfect face human DNA could create. This was me as a teenager, before learning it would be normal to meet a woman that beautiful once every long while in life and yet each one would seem like a one-of-a-kind type of perfection. Before learning how emotional or mental attraction intensifies beauty and makes one person's appearance so special. 

The category where Kate really stands out is as a visual masterpiece. It's like Blade Runner but sexier for homophobic men who can't let themselves get turned on by Harrison Ford. I do mean Blade Runner in particular as a point of comparison because the influence is so strong one could think the author of the story may have imagined it as a spinoff somewhere in the world of Blade Runner. Both films could easily appear in the dreams of the same cyberpunk-urban-dystopia-obsessed weeb.

Like Blade Runner, Kate would need better plot and/or pacing to entertain in the same way as the all-time great blockbuster classics. But like Blade Runner, it deserves to be remembered alongside blockbusters as its own type of classic for its own unique artistic accomplishment. In fact, it does what Blade Runner did even better. To me, subjectively, the visuals are even more interesting, with modern camera technology and CGI having their strengths played expertly (except the worst car chase scene ever done), and the urban-dystopic sets feeling realer and bigger and most of the time just plain cooler-looking. And I think I can say more objectively that the combat in Kate is far more impressive from virtually every filmmaking perspective than the combat in Blade Runner. 

In many films, you notice a significant difference between stunt doubles of major characters and what I'd call ""stunt extras,"" the pros playing henchman after henchman getting rapidly cut down by the main characters. It feels like henchmen and their bosses are a different species. In real life, it feels like henchmen and their bosses are human beings with different skills in different positions at different levels in life, which is how it feels in Kate. Every ""stunt extra"" whose character gets killed feels like they are portraying a *character* getting *killed*. They fight for their lives, not for the plot. This makes every boss fight Kate gets to feel less like a gimmick and more like a concerningly serious obstacle that legitimately boosts the difficulty level of her situation. Human beings are dangerous and every time she has to fight them it is a challenge, let alone the ones competent enough to rival her in that challenge. Not much plot is needed for this to create tension and suspense, or to motivate the viewer to sympathize with a character's feelings and goals. 

In many films, the main character is supposed to be a combat genius with years of high level professional track record proving it, and yet in 2 hours of footage there are numerous times where they use brute force to save themselves. Often these brute force moments would injure a person doing them in real life, and sometimes the movies let these moments injure the character, but then they just keep recklessly injuring themselves throughout the movie and it doesn't really make sense that they've survived so many combat engagements in their life using ""skill"" if this is the best they can do. And when there's a female action lead, there are often scenes where these brute force moments are taken to silly extremes to show that the female character is stronger than male characters, not just smarter. This really stops making sense when the same character punches people hard enough that they should be breaking their hand multiple times in the same movie.

Kate has an excuse for this. She is dying of radiation poisoning and using a cocktail of drugs to go out with a bang avenging her own murder. So when she's stronger than a man, it makes sense with the stimulants in her body. When injuries aren't adding up after a lot of hard hits, it's because of painkillers and the knowledge that it won't matter in a few hours anyway. When this supposed professional keeps getting into risky moments and coming out with injuries even though she's supposedly been skilled enough to survive years in her line of work, it's because you would take different risks in the effort to avenge your own death while you die of radiation poisoning compared to the way you've approached things throughout your career. This premise was such a simple and perfect choice to make the movie make sense.

To understand, it will help to prime yourself by picturing the analogy of the ""humans from monkeys"" fallacy. You might be familiar with this false argument against evolution, that humans cannot evolve from monkeys, and how it is invalid because evolutionary theory does not suggest humans evolved from monkeys, but that humans and monkeys evolved from a common ancestor. You must have your mind in the shape of this difference between the view of something that came from another related thing, and two related things that both came from some other unknown thing. Now look through that shape at the concept of trying to recognize Mary Elizabeth Winstead and notice the same shape within itself again, once on what caused her appearance to transform being what made me unable to recognize her, and once on how the visual distinctiveness that could have made her recognizable was able to go unnoticed throughout my whole viewing of the movie. 

*That face*. Trust me, I know that face. But I've learned you just meet a woman that beautiful once every long while and your perception can be warped by your feelings. Seeing that face, it didn't even occur to me that it might be Mary Elizabeth Winstead. My brain did not connect it back to her - it connected it back to a common ancestor. And I don't mean that as an analogy, I mean it literally. Sometimes, when I see a strikingly pretty girl, I remember seeing other girls with a very similar appearance, but I remember it being rare. So I chalk it up to them being descendants of the same beautiful ancestor whose strong genes are still propagating creating thousands of similarly beautiful girls all over the world sprinkled throughout the human population. The name ""Mary Elizabeth Winstead"" never entered my head looking at her face in this movie, but the face it reminded me of was hers - just, her ancient ancestor's. ""Hers,"" but a ""her"" whose name I don't know, forgotten to prehistory.

If the visual stimulus of seeing *that face* made my neurons go ""Mary Elizabeth Winstead"" that would be like humans evolving from apes. The visual stimulus making my neurons think of some common ancestor, who I originally thought of as Mary Elizabeth Winstead's ancestor, is like... humans and apes sharing some common ancestor. 

But did this film lean into the excuse its perfectly-devised context set up for it? No. Don't get me wrong, Kate takes about as much of a beating as the viewer can suspend disbelief for without her stopping, but that line is never crossed. The suspension of disbelief stays possible because instead of relying on brute force to get through everything, Kate is constantly using some of the smartest tactics and takedowns I've ever seen from an action movie hero. She has clearly played Half Life and thought about the ""run, think, shoot, live"" tagline a lot. She's an expert at using the environment to her advantage and adapting to every momentary change in the situation around her no matter how jarring or shocking. She will use leverage to break someone else's bones without putting so much force on her own. That's why she can do all this. 

By being so realistic, this movie might make you think a lot about real life. It's sort of a catch 22, it's too immersive for its own immersion. At one point, Kate has a reloading race with someone, each finding themselves without ammo at the same time and thrust into a competition to see which one can get their next magazine locked and loaded first. When the guy sees Kate is going to beat her, his disappointment is portrayed perfectly, and it really makes me think - millions of people have died on the front lines of wars since we came up with automatic firearms, this has to have happened to some of them. People really have died in moments of ""alright motherfucker, let's see which of us has done a better job training and preparing to do a quick reload- aaaa fuck it's not gonna be me."" That's wild. Sometimes an action movie can do that, show moments that have happened in the world that nobody really thinks about because they're the *final* moments for the people they happen to. I think it's a mark of a great action movie. 

Kate is impressive, both the movie and the character. But the movie kept making me think about real life and the character kept making me think about the actress. ""Who the hell is she? Who the hell is this badass combat lady with acting skills and *that face*? Where did she get these combat skills and yet end up as an actress? Is she really doing ALL her own stunts or just enough to make me wonder? How has she stayed under my radar with *that face*, or is she some, like, famous actress I've seen before, is that why I feel like I recognize her even though I don't think I have seen her in anything?""

I was falling in love with this actress for playing this character. I've been hurt by females a lot in my life, and my bitterness about weak-willed females is consuming. But occasionally a female puts a lot of effort into leaving her fingerprint on a work of art that stands as a beacon for the idea that women can do anything men can do. If she does a good enough job with it to weigh hope against my bitterness, such works of art are cathartic for me and make me fall in love. Kate is one such example. This effort was put into making her an action movie hero just as heroic as any male one, while being believable, while being female. Being badass without being fake about anatomical limitations. Being morally grounded without moral grandstanding. Letting the female sex of this character speak for itself without making cheap meta references to it in the movie or wedging it between political points. 

So I was confused about why it felt like I had seen this actress before when I couldn't think of anything I'd seen her in, but was that the main factor giving me an itch to figure out the answer? No. I *really* wanted to figure out who this woman was putting such effort and talent into portraying this badass character, because she must be one of my favorite human beings on the planet and I would want to know more about her and her worldview and her message for the world. 

By the end of the movie, her face wasn't just one of the rare women to match *that face*, one of the rare rough copies of that common ancestor. Instead her very presence was a beacon of hope. Sometimes I feel connected to all the infinite possible timelines, all the dimensions there might be where I'm doing different things, and I feel hope or fear or pride or shame about what I'm doing in this world or another one, being glad I'm in this timeline, or wishing I wasn't stuck in it. And I shit you not, this was one of those times, and I felt so glad to be in a timeline where one of the women with *that face* - one of the copies of *that* common ancestor - had gotten this message across to me, that she wanted me to know she could aspire to be just as epic of a hero as any man to star in an action movie. I almost didn't watch the movie and it felt like it must have been a catastrophe in all the timelines where I didn't. Yet at the same time, I was so reassured. It felt like this common ancestor must have known a common ancestor of mine too and we must have spent thousands of years going back and forth about the differences between men and women as our souls transferred through different bodies from generation to generation, always challenging each other to be the next stage of our better and better possible versions of ourselves, always coming to understand and respect each other in the end when we can figure out how to stop our flaws from hurting each other in each lifetime. This movie felt less and less like the work of a cast and crew, more and more like her own work of art, an expression from her of her deepest ultimate self - not even a fictional level of awesome but the real level of awesome inside her. It felt like she could have used this movie to argue with me about my politics but she specifically chose to keep her politics out of the movie because she knew I needed to see an example of a woman proving she could just have the exact same power fantasy as a ""male power fantasy"" without some kind of woke twist. Like that ancient ancestor reached through all of time to tell me ""hey, I know you hate the phrase male power fantasy cause you wish the two sexes could relate to each other more, but one reason you should have to feel better about it is I'm the hottest girl you think ever existed and I also hate the phrase male power fantasy because I can totally relate to having fantasies like that, so I'm gonna send one of my descendants to make a movie about this and soothe your soul when you're at a low point in 2021 thinking about some dumb ex who's not as hot as me."" What I'm saying is, I have paranoid schizophrenia. 

While the plot is predictably formulaic according to the female action hero tropes of our time, it is executed better than other virtually identical plots in other movies. Every cast member makes their character feel real and relatable. Small twists that you see coming sometimes catch you off-guard by making you go ""nah, they're not gonna do that."" But it's not *much* of a story. It wouldn't really be enough to work with if you wanted to convert it to prose. This is the weak point of the movie, but it really doesn't weaken the movie measurably, because the movie knows exactly what it's trying to do and does it fine without more plot. The simplicity of the story was a choice, not a mistake. Likewise, you could tune the immersion to stop making the viewer think about the real world so often, but then it wouldn't be so thought-provoking. I repeat: this movie knows exactly what it's trying to do, and does it fine. 

The reason I couldn't recognize Mary Elizabeth Winstead wasn't that she looks different from how she looked when she played Ramona Flowers. I have a collection of this woman's nudes, it is not unfamiliar to my brain how her appearance changed over time. It was that she was such a fucking badass of a woman and such an awesome actress that she was able to shape her body and appearance into that of Ramona Flowers in order to portray personalities like that of Ramona's character and then over time shape herself into an appearance better suited to another type of character, and Ramona Flowers never told me any of that shit. The Kate version of her looking so different from the Scott Pilgrim version of her, and that making her unrecognizable, would be like humans evolving from monkeys. But the true actress who was able to make herself into the form of Ramona Flowers, being unrecognizable to me in her ability to also transform herself into Kate, that is more like sharing a common ancestor. I had no idea she was such a great actress when I saw Scott Pilgrim vs the World, I knew she was pretty but I didn't know her face was something she was doing on purpose, manually, with her acting skills, and she would literally seem like a whole different actress, a whole different person, playing a very different character a few years later. Different voice, different demeanor, different skills, different *soul* - but no, the same soul, a soul with that much range and diversity. The soul of an actress.",1633185493.0,2021-10-02 16:38:13

[Discussion] The Most Important Scene In Midnight Mass,83,pxlkfh,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/pxlkfh/discussion_the_most_important_scene_in_midnight/,17," 

SPOILERS!!!!!!

I just finished Midnight Mass and have to say that while it was a partial slow burn it more than made up for that in the latter end of the series. The monologues of the characters while long kick off an engrossing debate regarding what it means to be faithful, and how we choose to execute that faith for both good intentions, and our darker inhibitions. Near the show's climax there is a scene that I thought perfectly embodied these themes of zealotry vs faithful worship.

By story's end the majority of the island has become infected by vampirism, and they've come under the sway of Bev Keane, the local civilian representative for the local church who has memorized bible scripture to a T, but embodies the religious zeal and bigotry that we've largely come to see in such figures who regurgitate and pervert language in such texts expressly for her own personal gain, but spin the outward appearance of unspeakable acts as being in greater service to God. Theft of money from the church, open prejudice, the murder of an animal, and aiding and abetting another murderer, these are all considered by her to be for ""the greater good"", but we consistently find her using scripture to absolve herself and those who do her bidding any guilt whatsoever the minute that they start to doubt ""the mission"". This abuse of personal beliefs culminates in Bev's coldest act, regarding a newly turned citizen of the community, and how despite the fact that he was turned w/o permission and in turn committing violent acts against his own family, she refuses to consider him a member of ""her"" congregation. To her faith and redemption are reliant on the physical acts of attending church, memorizing scripture, donations, and following her orders to the letter.

This is exactly where we see the inverse of this manipulation of what are meant to be teachings of peace and tolerance by none other than the antagonist himself, the Monsignor who facilitated these acts in the first place in the name of finding a second chance at happiness for his deteriorating love and the greater community. From the get go Monsignor Pruitt did his best to ingratiate himself w/ the community w/o regard to their past actions, state of mind, or whether or not they were a regular parishioner. Yes, he's slowly giving them the blood, but he's also helping them confront their own demons. Most importantly in the cases of both Riley and Joe who respectively made their most grievous sins while under the influence of alcohol, but he still doesn't abandon them to oblivion. He starts an A.A. chapter right on the island, brings some limited peace to Riley, and winds up bringing Joe to the table by virtue of the ""blood of Christ"" healing his shooting victim's back injury from his gunfire. Flashforward to the aforementioned expelling of Bev's unintentional victim, and Monsignor still reserves a place in his church for anyone and everyone. He calls out to this man to join him in God's house.

THIS is at the heart of the show's conflict where the actual teachings of a given religion, whatever someone may follow, conflict w/ that of their most fervent followers. Unrelenting zealotry combined w/ a purely encyclopedic knowledge of psalms is meaningless when the lessons of the faith aren't applied at a human level. ""We are made in God's image"", we make mistakes, commit horrible crimes, but we are given the free will to do that as well as seek redemption for those crimes. That's what the Bev's and those weak willed enough to fall for their machinations never understand, and I felt like Mike Flannagan did an amazing job demonstrating that in his story.",1632881521.0,2021-09-29 04:12:01

[Discussion] The Midnight Gospel is Truly Excellent,895,pwgwt8,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/pwgwt8/discussion_the_midnight_gospel_is_truly_excellent/,102,"I recently watched the series after being casually interested for a while. It's an animated show created by Adventure Time's Pendleton Ward and the podcaster Duncan Trussell. It follows a space podcaster who uses a multiverse simulator to travel to worlds on the brink of destruction (usually due to avoidable operator error) where he interviews the inhabitants. The interviews use audio from actual Duncan Trussell podcasts, with occasional lines added to make a clearer plot and for the conversation to be slightly more relevant to the bizarre chaos unfolding onscreen. It's a great mix of relatable and surreal, comical and profound with a deep and varied scifi element; I wasn't super familiar with Trussell's work before this but the conversations are genuinely interesting, relaxed and informative- which makes sense since a lot of the guests specialise in the topics that are raised. It's quite high concept so I imagine it'd be a love or hate situation, even though I'm firmly a lover I can understand both stances.

And then I went to see the reviews. Holy crap. The movie was PANNED HARD. Like pretty much every critic hates it. A 22% on Rotten Tomatoes? That’s just painful.

Reading the reviews, most of them seem to say (with a few minor variations) roughly the same thing - it’s too predictable a melodrama. Every sappy sweet moment is milked for the exact result you think it will. And the thing is, in hindsight, I think they’re probably right. The movie doesn’t really swerve in any totally unexpected way. It’s pretty much predictable. I guess it’s just one more totally obvious, completely logical, totally realistic story about two people on a journey through their grief. What I don’t get is: how the Hell is that bad? How is a slice of well-acted realistic life not a perfectly reasonable goal? And what were critics looking for? They get a divorce? She’s an alien in the third act? I couldn’t tell you. I just know that I was moved by this utterly predictable film in a way that I haven’t been moved by a drama in a very, very, very long time. Maybe that makes me pedestrian. I’m just saying, I can’t be the only pedestrian out there, and if there are as many of us as I think then I don’t think the critics who judged this film so harshly are using any kind of useful barometer.",1632794081.0,2021-09-28 03:54:41

[Discussion] Squid game is a bad overhyped show,1332,pvnkqx,NetflixBestOf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/pvnkqx/discussion_squid_game_is_a_bad_overhyped_show/,1064,"Sorry for if my grammar is bad, english is not my mother tongue.

Most of the serie is literally ppl dying for not reason, it breaks his own rules all the time, I can't see how the ppl love this mess.

Everything wrong with it:
1. The vote for ending the game after the first game is completely unrealistic and a wasted of time:
 
Statistically in most subjects votes ends in a range of 60-65%/35-40%, now imagine a game which you can can lose your life, the whole scene showing a perfect 50-50 is completely ridiculous.

Even if it weren't ridiculous whats the point of preteding if a 50-50 split if they still would end the games, it serves no purpose but a fake suspense scene. 

They could have show mostly everyone voting yes to leave and then coming back like did, it would be more realistic and shocking when the majority of ppl coming back to the games.

2. The policemen could just shot the frontmen when he was in the base many times like he did to 29 and pretend to be him, he didn't cuz the plot needed the brother reveal in the end, literally bullshit, he could have shot him so many many times.

3. What's the point of the games if players can just kill each other at night:

Literally what's the point, it hurts the actual games cuz they can sleep well hurting their performance and it already break the point have games why not put them in a island like every other battleroyale/survivor movie, it just stupid, the point of everyone has a chance is beating the challenge not just killing ppl for no reason.

4.The whole VIP bullshit is just top tier trash and easily the worse part of the series: 

In what world or sport the VIP spectators arrive when half of the games are done, who the f starts watching a horse race in the middle of the race, they even comment about the history of 2 characters when they weren't even there to know about it!!

Everything about the vip is just  a pointless waste of time.

5.Tempered glass game: the point of winning the games, is that you didn't die right? Guess what they even break that rule, they destroy the glass in the most stupid way I can think of, killing the girl that already won the stupid game for LITERALLY NO REASON, SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF ANYTHING IF U CAN DIE OUTSIDE THE GAMES AND EVEN IN THE VERY MOMENT U ALREADY WON, The show breaks it own rules all the time, for the most stupid reason I have ever seen.

6.The squid game has not point: is literally just a battle royale at this point not even a game.

7. The front men is the policemens brother: 

This is just cliche and bad writing for literally no reason, it would be okay if the policeman didn't had many opportunities to just shot him at his base and take his mask multiples times like I said.

8. The old men was the real leader all along:

So the ends ruins the best part of the show, the old men dying was the best and most heartbreaking and human part of the series and they ruin it making the oldmen literally the mastermind behind all, at these point most death were for not reason, meaningless and not even in the actually games (the point of the show)

9. The woman killing herself with the bully: 

She could have  push him when he was distracted, that just bad writing to kill characters in a rush, that woman would have never done that in the context of her character

10. Everything the policemen did was for nothing.

But the blood you have in your body generally continues to work, so death is slow. Also, it turns out you can survive mild to moderate ARS, mostly by treating the side effects like bone marrow death. Increased cancer risk is still a long term problem though.) Neat plot device aside, did anyone else find that poisoning someone with radiation and setting the film in Japan is a little... unconformable? In real life, Japan experienced the most cases of radiation sickness and radiation death in the world via the atomic bombings (including the 3rd test bombing that irradiated a Japanese fisherman to death by accident). I know the Russians use Polonium as a poison, too. But setting an action film in Japan and killing the main character with radiation poisoning just *feels* a little uncomfortable especially since both the choice of poison and the setting seem so deliberately chosen.",1632509266.0,2021-09-24 20:47:46
